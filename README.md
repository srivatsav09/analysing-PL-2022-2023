# Analysing-PL-2022-2023

**Hi there!**

Just Compiled a few stats from the last season of the premier league in this file

You can check stats like goals scored, shots taken , attendance in each stadium , no of cards given to each team

I have also predicted the no of goals Manchester United will score in the next Home and Away match using Linear Regression

The link to the csv file is <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thamersekhri/premier-league-stats-2022-2023"> here </a>

Any doubts..Do reach me!

Cheers
